## Guidelines of coding

1. Board should be of configurable width, height 
and mines number.<br/>
2. Should display an indication of the number of remaining flags above the board.<br/>
3. Click on cell reveals the value underneath it:<br/>
4. If it is a mine, you lose. Otherwise, display the number of mines around the cell (or empty if there are no mines around).<br/>
5. If there are no mines around the cell, reveal all cells around it and and all cells around any adjacent empty cell.
6. Shift+Click puts or removes a flag on that cell. (and updates the number of remaining flags).<br/>
7. A flagged cell cannot be revealed (click does nothing) until the flag is removed.
If all mines are flagged correctly, you win.

#General Notes

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
